				desc: '<p style="width:90%">Berlin is an 8yo neutered male German Shepherd with a gorgeous white coat dropped off at a shelter by his family that had to move. He had a very difficult time with the confusion/stress at the shelter. He is currently about 70lbs. With less stress, gradually increased exercise & his very good appetite he will easily put on 10lbs to be in a healthy weight. He will eat anything, but has no food aggression.  He will ride & jump in the car, but is a bit anxious, mostly because he doesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s next. Same with putting the leash over his head at times, although this is getting much better as he builds trust with his foster family. </p><p style="width:90%">Berlin sits, handshakes on command, responds consistently to his name & walks on a leash. He is learning it is okay to bark 2-3 times then he must settle quietly. He LOVES to snuggle & be petted but does not jump on people. He presents physically more like a 5yo & is quite athletic.</p><p style="width:90%">Berlin would easily conform to any routine & provide a family or individual with excellent companionship & devotion. He is a joy!  CJVA</p>', linum: '3045', leaf: true},

From what we can tell, he can see things directly in front of him, but his peripheral vision is lacking.  He is very friendly and affectionate once he knows you, but a stranger should not enter your home without an escort, or Bob will right on the job.  He gets along well with female dogs, even playing and flirting with them, and he got along OK with Remo and Maximus -  But he can have an attitude with some male dogs. He has made tremendous improvement in his ability to get along with other dogs since he arrived here in December.   He loves trips down to the river and stays close by your side.  Bob is a good rider in the car and well behaved in the house while we are at work.  He loves to play with balls and even throws them for himself in our backyard.  He does not mind going into the crate and even curls up in there to take a nap once in a while.  He has KEEN hearing and will bark at any dog hears on TV.

He can climb a fence, so a home where he will be leash walked or let out under supervision is needed. Buddy is new to us this week so not much is known about him yet, but he seems to be great dog.

I have a kiss for everyone that I happen to meet, from a toddler in a stroller to adults along the way.  My Mom and Dad had to give me up when they took in a family member that is allergic to dogs, and she went back to school fulltime.  I know it was a hard decision for them to come to.  I am 4 years young and just about in the prime of my life.  I love every dog that I meet and enjoy playing with my foster sister and brothers.  I do enjoy the company of other dogs in the house, and if you have cats I can learn to love them as well.  When it is time to settle down, I am quiet and content to lie down near where you are at.  I enjoy hanging out in the kitchen as well but my foster Dad says I can&rsquo;t eat what he eats so I enjoy grain free kibble and the occasional rawhide bones to chew on.  He bought me this weird purple thing called a Jolly Ball and I must say that thing is a lot of fun!  I will actively seek it out anywhere in the yard and am in doggy heaven getting to carry it around.

				goodkids: 'Unknown', gooddogs: 'Yes', goodcats: 'No',
				house: 'Yes', crate: 'Yes',  ns: 'Yes',
				desc: '<p style="width:90%">At the tender age of 11 months, Dino is already 85 lbs, so he is going to be a big boy when he&rsquo;s fully grown!  He was turned over to VGSR because his owner developed serious allergies to him and was unable to interact with Dino regularly.  While Dino is just a goofy, happy puppy right now, he has an excellent, stable temperament that is befitting of a German shepherd. He is confident and curious, fearless, and not easily startled by loud noises or sudden movements.  Dino is appropriately aloof with strangers, though if they pay attention to him his tail will start wagging and try to go visit, an excellent trait in a puppy.  I believe once he gets older and matures he will become more aloof with strangers, preferring the attention of his family over all else.  Right now we are working hard to socialize him to all sorts of environments, sounds, people, and smells, because as a large, powerful adult, it will be important for him to know what "normal" looks like so he can react appropriately when things are not "normal."</p><p style="width:90%">As with many GSDs, Dino is very focused on his people and extremely affectionate with us; he loves to interact with us, whether it&rsquo;s for a long game of fetch, cuddling, or just lying at our feet gnawing on a marrow bone.  He must still think he&rsquo;s a little 20 lb puppy, because he loves nothing more than to bring his ball or chew toy over to you and climb into your lap as he chews on it.  Dino has been pretty easy to train, as he has a lot of drive, enthusiasm and focus for work.  He is moderately food motivated and extremely toy motivated.  For this reason, his ideal adoptive family would find some sort of sport or job for him to do - whether this be Schutzhund, agility, herding, rally, or just a set of obedience courses - Dino is a dog that would be happiest if kept active both physically and mentally.</p><p style="width:90%">Currently Dino is living with another male dog (and a cat that&rsquo;s in hiding).  While they do get along, Dino has a tendency to be dominant and tries to do a lot of dominance posturing.  Coupled with his large size, he can come across as very intimidating, however he means no harm and really just wants to play.  There is no aggression towards dogs or people.  The dominant behavior is one of the issues that we have been working on, and he has been responding well.  Dino would thrive in a home that has a clear set of rules and a firm and fair leader that he can look up to, so he doesn&rsquo;t feel the need to be the top dog all the time.  His behavior with cats is unknown, but my guess is that he would probably want to chase.  Because of his large size and puppy clumsiness, he would do best in a home with older children.  Dino&rsquo;s adoptive family should be prepared to continue his socialization and participate in some kind of obedience training.  Dino has the potential to be an incredible dog, and a stellar ambassador for the GSD breed.  He will make a loyal, loving companion for a lucky family.

A nice family rescued him from a kill shelter in the Richmond area but was not able to keep him due to an already full house of kids and dogs so he came to be with a foster in Northern Virginia in late November.</p><p style="width:90%">Duke needs love and obedience training - no one has  taught him the rules.  He&rsquo;s a snuggler and loves to wake you up with a cold nose touching the tip of yours. He is definitely 100% German Shepherd and would like nothing better than to be the lead dog.   Not much of a barker and he&rsquo;s only 60 lbs &ndash; which makes him about 10 lbs underweight.  The stress of a shelter will do that to you.   He&rsquo;s eating and getting exercise now and would be a great fit as a running partner or for someone active.    Duke loves walks and will nose his leash to let you know when he&rsquo;d like to go out.</p><p style="width:90%">Not sure how he is with cats but he does well one on one with most dogs.  He&rsquo;s working on this as he goes for walks and adoption events.

Ebony is a sweet middle aged girl who gets along fine with everyone. Ebony and her foster are working on weight loss, but have discovered that she has an underactive thyroid which accounts for some of her excess weight. She will require an inexpensive daily medication  for the rest of her life but it is one small pill a day. In the two weeks she has been on the medication we have seen a marked improvement in her energy level. She does not get on the furniture, doesn&rsquo;t chew on anything, can be loose in the house when no one is home, rides great in the car and doesn&rsquo;t pull on the leash. Ebony currently shares a home with three other large GSDs, two cats and a rowdy 4-month old puppy. Moderate, low-impact exercise is best for me, and I enjoy a nice soft bed. Although Ebony may not be a speed demon she has no problem negotiating the stairs in her foster home. Her former owner has stated that she had attained CGC. If you are looking for a devoted well behaved companion Ebony is your girl. Ebony was stressed living in the rental unit and had chewed the hair off her tail but it is probably also related to the undetected thyroid condition.

I was dropped off at the shelter at 8 weeks old by my breeder. Lucky for me, VGSR scooped me right up. You see, I am special needs.

He will be a big guy and if not trained and socialized properly (as every dog should be) he will not become all that he can be.  Training will be a must for him.

She&rsquo;s about 5.5 years old (date of birth May 16, 2006) and she&rsquo;s obviously had some pretty good training. I took her out to a fenced area at the shelter to meet her before we came home. Even out there she listened to me and responded to "sit," "down," and "stay." I was very impressed. We went for a long walk before coming home and although she didn&rsquo;t maintain the "heel" position, she never once pulled on the leash.  She is a little wary of strangers right now, which isn&rsquo;t surprising given what has happened to her in the past two weeks, dumped from her original home and what was supposed to be her new home. She will need some time to adjust and bond with a new owner, but even though she didn&rsquo;t know me, she was fine with me and even listened and followed commands on the first day. Hannah is probably best described as "shell-shocked" right now, but I predict that she will settle in, bond with a new person, and become a very loyal and attentive dog. She will need someone who is willing to give her the time and will put out some effort to earn her trust and affection. She&rsquo;s probably not a good choice for someone with young children or a noisy, busy household, or for anyone who needs instant gratification. She is smart.

No one told him that he had to keep his ears pointed up - so he has floppy ears, that make him look even more adorable!   He tries very hard to please and listens to every word that you say, with that typical &rsquo;GSD head tilt&rsquo; that looks so cute!  He gets along great with my female Golden Retriever. He also gets along wonderfully in a crowd-whether Human or dogs. He loves children and loves to play ball - ALL the time!   Hercules has been neutered recently.  He was surrendered to a shelter by his owners, who said that they could not &rsquo;afford&rsquo; to keep him.</p><p style="width:90%">Hercules is allergic to Gluten/ wheat and should only be fed gluten free  dog food -we currently feed him Harmony farms, which is easily available in supermarkets like Giant.  Hercules has the sweetest, most lovable disposition - all he wants to do is please! He will stick to his &rsquo;pack leader&rsquo; like glue and curl up near your feet all evening, follow you around and beg to play fetch or tug-o-war.  If you are looking for an obedient and faithful friend, look no further - Hercules is the one for you! Once he knows you ,he will sit, lay, come and stay when asked.  He is also very smart, laid back and easy to teach.  He is an excellent example of the &rsquo;perfect GSD&rsquo; -  an absolute delight to be with.

In the first home, she didn&rsquo;t care for the resident dogs, which is surprising because she gets along very well with the dogs in her foster home, especially Crystal, whom she plays with for hours. In this respect, we must say that she picks her friends carefully and may not get along with all other dogs. In the two other adoptive homes, Isabelle had bonded almost instantly with her new family, both of which included children. However in both instances, she snapped at people she didn&rsquo;t know, which was likely based out of fear and the desire to "protect" her "flock".</p><p style="width:90%">Because of these factors, Isabelle will NOT be placed in a home with lots of activity and people coming/going. She will also not be placed in a home with children - not due to her inability to get along with children, but due to her overprotective nature. An adult-only, quiet home would be needed OR someone with much experience in formal training and socialization to help her overcome her fears.</p><p style="width:90%">If you are an APPROVED adopter, contact <a href="mailto:Iresqgsds@aol.com">Iresqgsds@aol.com</a> to learn how to meet her.

His previous home was getting divorced and could no longer keep him so they dropped him off at the shelter. JJ is a great high energy dog and would be great for a home with active family members or another dog to play with. He does play a little rough with other dogs, and does fine with cats but can sometimes play a little rough with them too. He doesn&rsquo;t mean them any harm, he just likes to run. The ideal home for JJ is a one story home with some children or another dog to play with and possibly a pool to swim in which is the best exercise for him due to his hips. JJ does have hip dysplasia and hip arthritis but you would never know it. He has seen a certified Orthopedic Surgeon who believes that surgery currently would do more harm than any good, so JJ may or may not need surgery in the future.

He has always had a good temperment, but has become more mellow as he&rsquo;s gotten older.  He is always guarding the house, either looking out the front door or sleeping in the foyer.  He also likes sitting in our back yard and looking out the front gate.  He likes being near us, but is no lap dog.  He likes short walks up the block and back.  Kaiser is in good health and up to date on all of his shots, but he is a bit overweight (113 lbs) and is slow going up stairs.  He is not good with cats.

She is only six years old, and this is an injury that happened many years ago before she came to VGSR. Her knees have gotten so bad that she now has bone on bone. Lucy is in a great deal on pain and has a hard time walking long distances. She needs help getting in and out of cars, or even jumping on the bed. It hasn&rsquo;t gotten her spirit down, but the pain is very evident for her. Due to the extensive wear-and-tear on her knees, she will forever suffer from arthritis and need to be on glucosamine/chondroiton, and perhaps anti-inflammatory for the rest of her life. The surgery will be able to help her run again without intense pain and consequences though. This is a very expensive procedure, so any donations are welcome and greatly appreciated.</p><p style="width:90%">The last picture of Lucy shows how she has to sit due to the fact she cannot bend her knees, as the pain is too great.</p><p style="width:90%">My little Lucy Lou, she&rsquo;s just the best!! After hearing she was being surrendered by her owners of six years I felt extreme sadness for Lucy. I thought how much pain she would be in; losing the only family she has ever known. I thought of the pain that would cause my dogs, and just could even imagine how hard the transition would be for her. Well, I was wrong. Lucy acclimated herself within the first hour. At home, she just started picking up toys and dropping them on you, waiting to be thrown so she can chase them. She also enjoys playing tug quite a bit. You&rsquo;d never know this girl is six years old; she has the energy of a young pup. She&rsquo;s a major cuddle bug, always in your face kissing you. She does this cute little crawl where she&rsquo;ll be laying on the bed and just scoot herself over to you, or scoot and crawl to switch positions. As with any and every sable I&rsquo;ve seen&ndash;she is QUIRKY!</p><p style="width:90%">Lucy has such a personality; she really proves that she&rsquo;s more than &quot;just a dog&quot;. She likes to speak her mind and once she gets started, you can&rsquo;t quiet her up. She&rsquo;s just overly excited and does her happy little bark that goes on and on. To many people it can be annoying, but to me it&rsquo;s cute. She just wants a family to interact with her. This can explain why she was so happy to find a new home with people to love.</p><p style="width:90%">Lucy was with her family since puppyhood, but as it sometimes goes, new pets and new additions come along, soon casting you aside. Poor Lucy was mainly kept away from the family (and little did she know they were seeking to give her up) while the other dog was still a part of the family. A long came a new baby, and Lucy wasn&rsquo;t allowed to be in the house because she shed and they didn&rsquo;t want the baby crawling in her hair. Lucy wasn&rsquo;t taken on car rides either, because her hair would get on the car seats. She also didn&rsquo;t have the best diet&ndash;she&rsquo;s been eating Old Roy for a long time, so it coat isn&rsquo;t shiny as it could be. Her family wasn&rsquo;t terrible; they just didn&rsquo;t provide Lucy with the love she needed, which is why she is so happy now in my care.</p><p style="width:90%">When it comes to a potential home for Lucy, I am looking for someone who wants a Velcro dog and will play a very active role in her life. I&rsquo;d like for a family that loves to take their dogs on walk, engage in stimulating activities for the dog and just smother them with affection. Lucy is wonderful with kids and people of all ages, and does great will all of my dogs. I haven&rsquo;t seen an ounce of aggression from her anywhere. She is a marvelous, beautiful girl who deserves nothing less than the best.  Oh, she&rsquo;s quite a big girl too, so don&rsquo;t be fooled.

It&rsquo;s OK though, because I had plenty of practice getting around on only three legs while I was at the shelter.  While I&rsquo;m scared of my foster mom (she&rsquo;s always doing stuff like looking at my incision, putting t-shirts on me, giving me meds, and taking me to the vet), I&rsquo;m less scared of my grandma (human) who is at home with me all day long and all the other dogs and cats that live here, although I tend to guard my food from the other dogs, so I eat in my crate.  I&rsquo;m good about going potty outside, and typically raise a fuss if I really have to go and nobody&rsquo;s paying attention to me, therefor I&rsquo;m considered crate-trained.  I spend a lot of time in my crate because it&rsquo;s a nice, quiet, safe place where I&rsquo;m out of harms way and because I&rsquo;m still recovering from my amputation.  I still need some time to heal and a LOT of TLC, but I can do both either here in my foster home or in yours.  I&rsquo;m an easy dog to have around, but I&rsquo;m shy, scared of a lot of things, and insecure, so I need a tremendous amount of patience.

Otto, originally named Lobo, was relinquished to the Harrisonburg SPCA by an owner who kept him on a chain and apparently did not allow much interaction with anyone in the household.  Otto was not house-broken when he came in.</p><p style="width:90%">He did not know how to play with a ball.  He did not know any commands.  In the shelter kennel, Otto began snarling and snapping at anyone who came near, but this appears to have been "cage brave," uncertainty about being held in the small space.  The shelter was scheduled to put him down when a VGSR volunteer saw Otto&rsquo;s potential and asked that they hold off for another day or two.  The short story is that Otto was given a temperament test after some &quot;coaching&quot; by the shelter&rsquo;s dog manager.  The test was given by the VGSR volunteer and the dog manager.  He did well enough on that, with no aggression whatsoever, simply showing ignorance, as described above, like peeing on the dog manager&rsquo;s shoe, perhaps a sign that he had already bonded with her!  He was then bathed, neutered, given pain medicine and slept most of the way from Harrisonburg to Fredericksburg to an Animal Behaviorist.</p><p style="width:90%">Otto was re-evaluated and it was discovered that Otto was hit by his human care givers. Otto has started his rehabilitation, and is turning into a wonderful dog.  When he first meets humans, he becomes very mouthy and playful. This is a side affect from being chained and interacting with people from the end of a chain. He is slowly learning that this is inappropriate behavior, but it will take some time. Otto is house broken, crate trained, rides well in the car, is learning basic obedience commands, and adjusting to living in a house very nicely. Otto is slow to warm up to strangers (another side affect from being chained), so needs to go to a home that understands this behavior. This will go away in time, if his new forever home is willing to work with him. All of the information and training will be provided to his new owners.</p><p style="width:90%">Otto is the type of dog that will NOT allow a stranger to come into the house if none of his family is home.</p><p style="width:90%">Otto needs a strong and patient leader, that knows how to establish boundaries in a fair manner.

However, it has been determined that she has hip dysplasia.  Her left side is worse than her right.  Her hip dysplasia does not seem to be causing her any pain or discomfort at this point and time.  She takes Dasuquin daily.</p><p style="width:90%">Sandy is a medium energy dog and loves to run and play and is good with other dogs.  She will be twelve months old on March 22nd.  She is an owner surrender that they purchased from a back yard breeder.  More information on Sandy will be posted as it becomes available.

				desc: '<p style="width:90%">This is Shadow, he was with the same family from a puppy but when they were due another child they decided they didn&rsquo;t want him anymore. You would not believe he is 8, he has a bundle of energy and is a very loving gentle boy. He loves his walks and really enjoys going to the dog park and playing fetch with his ball. He is friendly with all other dogs and loves humans if you are looking for a velcro dog he is your guy. Being with a family for so long and an indoor dog he is fully house trained and really good around children. He might let you know if someone walks by but welcomes all guests very enthusiastically. He needs to lose about 15 pounds and we are doing really well on that, he does have some hip issues but please don&rsquo;t stop reading, with some inexpensive monthly medication he is as good as new, though a home where he does not have to use lots of stairs to enter the house would be better for him long term.  He is the sweetest boy and easiest dog to have and does not have an aggressive bone in his body. He does not need crating and is happy to be left in the house when he will curl up and sleep the day away. He communicates when he wants to go out and also when he wants cuddles and belly rubs. He will sleep by your bed every night and will not disturb you until you wake up and sometimes likes to lay in himself. He would make a wonderful addition to any family, he is an all round really good dog and an excellent example of the breed. This boy deserves a loving caring home who will make him part of the family, so if you are an approved adopter and want to know more about Shadow please contact me at <a href="mailto:jacciandstu@aol.com">jacciandstu@aol.com</a>  GJSVA</p>', linum: '3168', leaf: true},

Snowy is my name - just in case you missed it.  I am between 4 & 5 months old. I am a white shepherd with some tan spots on my ears (that makes me unique).  My foster family doesn&rsquo;t think I am going to be a very big guy when I am all grown. I am quite high energy and I love to wrestle and play every opportunity I get.</p><p style="width:90%">I was taken to the shelter since my original owner left me with someone and never came back for us.... So I am also one of the lucky ones. VGSR stepped up for me and now I am in a foster home with lots of other playmates (ok, some not so willingly) and YES, I LOVE TO PLAY!</p><p style="width:90%">I come across very shy at first, I just need to get use to new situations and people - but after that &quot;its so on&quot;!  So how about it? Are you looking for a little guy like me?  Will you keep me forever and take care of me (which will include training)?  I will reward you in so many ways, and pay you in so many doggie kisses.  LTVA	</p>', linum: '3199',

				desc: '<p style="width:90%">Sophie came to VGSR from a shelter in Spotsylvania County.  She&rsquo;s a gentle, low-energy dog who is happy just sleeping at her handler&rsquo;s feet.  Though she doesn&rsquo;t know many commands, she responds well to gentle correction and coaxing.  She&rsquo;s being treated for heartworms, Ehrlichia (a tick-born illness), and may thereafter have hip surgery to reduce her hip pain.  Though she&rsquo;s currently undergoing these veterinary treatments, VGSR would consider adopting her to an approved family who commits to completing these treatments.  Sophie would do well in a quiet household, where she could minimize her use of stairs.  If you&rsquo;d like to meet Sophie, please watch the Events page for her Adoption Day appearances.  This easy-going girl is guaranteed to reduce your blood pressure. LniVA</p>', linum: '3324',

				desc: '<p style="width:90%">Thora was happy when her pups went elsewhere so she could recover from the stress of raising puppies under bad conditions with bad nutrition.  She bounced back very quickly, however, and is now a good looking black/grey/silver beauty.  Thora appears to have had some experience as a housedog; she crates well and took the stairs without difficulty.  She can jump a 4&rsquo; fence but she doesn&rsquo;t do so to get away, just to get to her person; still, she shouldn&rsquo;t be left outside unattended in anything less than a 6&rsquo; fence.  Thora is a sweet girl.  She still remembers the volunteer who pulled her and the pups from the shelter and she shows her appreciation every time they meet.  She took a couple days to settle in here, but she has been an easy foster and I think will make someone a very wonderful and devoted companion.

				desc: '<p style="width:90%">Uncle Joe is a 5-6 year old male, who came to us as an owner surrender from a good Samaritan who rescued him from his former owner who was going to shoot him.  Why someone would want to shoot such a nice boy is incomprehensible.  But clearly Uncle Joe&rsquo;s well-being was not at the forefront of his mind.  Uncle Joe came to us intact and with a nasty old hip injury which badly needed surgical intervention.  Uncle Joe is now on the mend from being neutered and having an FHO.</p><p style="width:90%">Uncle Joe is getting along quite well in his foster home.  He&rsquo;s living with four other dogs, all loose in the house 24/7.  He appears to be completely housebroken!  There are cats here too, which are mostly just fun to watch, but he likes to keep them on their toes.  Uncle Joe has separation anxiety, which means he needs to be crated when no one is home.  Idealistically, Uncle Joe&rsquo;s fantasy home would include someone who had the privilege of taking their dog to work daily with them, worked from home, or was retired.</p><p style="width:90%">Uncle Joe often growls at other dogs at first meeting, which I believe was a coping mechanism:  "don&rsquo;t bother me, my hip hurts", but clearly is not truly dog-aggressive, as he&rsquo;s living peacefully with a bunch of other dogs.

She loves new people, dogs, places.  She is very curious about everything around her and is does not appear to be afraid of anything.  She loves to snuggle and gives great kisses.  She plays well with all her full sized brothers and sisters.  She is all puppy and loves to chew.  We are working on housetraining, but are not there yet.  She loves playing with 2-leggers and 4-leggers.  Wendy still needs basic obedience and house training... though her foster parents are working with her. She is very smart and already knows sit... especially if a treat is involved (which she takes very gently).  Wendy needs someone that will love her forever, help her learn her basics, and keep her exploring all the exciting things in the world!!!  DGVA</p>', linum: '3277',

				desc: '<p style="width:90%">What a love!  Winston is a sweet, smart, shy, delightful young pup.  He was left in the shelter along with his 5 siblings, some of whom are also in VGSRâ€™s care.  Winston is adjusting to the many changes he has undergone in his short life.   He shows typical puppy curiosity until a noise or movement startles him and sends him to the safety of his crate.  He comes back quickly, happy for some petting and loving.  Winston is enjoying the quiet attention of his foster parents.  It is apparent that he was under-socialized and his foster family is working on building his confidence and exposing him to new things.  We believe that he will come out of his shell with training and patience as he learns quickly and wants to please.  He gets along well with other dogs â€“ especially, if they want to play with him.  Winston is enjoying nibbling on antlers and nylabones.  His foster parents will update Winstonâ€™s information as we get to know him better.  Winston will be attending adoption events, so check the Current Events Page to learn which events he is attending or if you are an approved adopter, ask your VGSR caseworker about him.  Winston will do best in a relatively quiet home with humans who have experience with GSDs, who will take him to training classes and spend the time needed to help him realize his potential.
